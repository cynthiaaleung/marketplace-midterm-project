### Message Inbox:
The Messages inbox displays a list of all message threads the current user is a part of. Each row represents a thread and displays the sender's name, the message subject, and the most current message body. The view button renders the message thread.

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
